## *ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS*

*•Discount on credit card purchases should be encouraged*

*•More adverts on our health and beauty products*

*•There is room for improvement in Mandalay and Yangon city, more investment on advertisement for branches in the two cities*
 
*•The loyalty card(members) made a little more sales in comparison to the normal customers. The total purchases made by members is $164,223 compared to $158,743 purchases made by normal customers, hence I can conclude that there’s a little differences in customers turnover.*
